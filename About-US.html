    <p><h3>Leqa Coffee</h3></p>
    
    <p title="-"><p>
    
    Coffee company Leqa was established in February of 2017. 
    A purpose-built roastery was designed and built, following a detailed assessment and research into the coffee business in Ethiopia and on the continent.
    Leqa is a subsidiary of Royalty Holdings (RH). 
    Royalty Holdings has had twelve years of experience in the services sector. 
    
    <br>Leqa coffee is primarily engaged in coffee roasting and grinding and is developing a chain of retail outlets. 
    At the roastery in Addis Ababa and Nekemte, a coffee museum/gallery has been curated in order to teach the public about the business of coffee in Ethiopia. 
    In time, the leqa brand will include a ‘3C’ product portfolio – coffee, cake, and chocolate. 
    The journey for coffee and cake is well started and for chocolate, it is in progress with the construction of a processing plant in the planning.</br>
